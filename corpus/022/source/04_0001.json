These function mainly to establish anaphoric reference and to indicate that the entity in question will continue as the topic of discourse (88b, c), but they can also be used to mark contrastive focus (e.g. 88a) or just for emotional purposes, as shown here by the 1SG possessive marker (88d). In addition, they add a nuance of involving the addressee in what is being said. This is in stark contrast to other Turkic languages (with the exception of Dolgan, see below): in the corpus analysed by Fraurud, out of 3,492 nouns none carried second person possessive suffixes (Fraurud 2001: 251).",
