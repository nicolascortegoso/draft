# Morphologically Annotated Sequences

The dataset is organized into folders, each representing a collection of sequences from a specific source material.
Within each folder, there are three subfolders: 'source', 'pending', and 'processed'.

The 'source' folder contains files in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation) with the following fields:

- source: A reference to the original work on Yakut morphology.
- page/section: The location of the source material within the reference.
- chapter: The general aspect of Yakut morphology under discussion.
- topic: The specific aspect of Yakut morphology under discussion.
- notes: Explanations and observations provided by the authors, relevant to the analysis.
- sah: The original sentence in the Yakut language, as found in the source material.
- ru: The corresponding Russian gloss or translation of the Yakut sentence, as provided in the source material.

Each file typically corresponds to a topic, part of a chapter, or a section of the source material.

The 'pending' folder contains JSON files derived from the 'source' folder after being processed through the morphological analyzer.

An additional field, 'analyses', is added to each file, containing the raw output from the morphological pipeline. This output may include:

- Multiple interpretations for the same token (morphological ambiguity).
- Instances where the pipeline failed to analyze the token.

Each analyzed token includes the following fields:

- pos: The token's position in the sequence.
- text: The surface form of the token as it appears in the sequence.
- type: The category of the token (e.g., word, punctuation).
- fst: The morphological transducer that performed the analysis.
- root: The lexical root of the token.
- affixes: An ordered list of affixes attached to the lexical root.

The 'processed' folder contains JSON files that have been manually disambiguated, ensuring that each token has only one analysis.
This folder represents the final output, while the 'pending' folder serves as a transitional stage.

### Conventions and Guidelines for Organizing Samples
The following conventions are used to organize samples into folders and files:

#### 1. Aggregation by Source
- Samples are grouped primarily by source rather than being scattered across multiple sources.
- The goal is to collect multiple samples related to a specific topic, rather than isolated examples from different sources.
- Consequently, the 'source' field is the same for all files within a folder.

#### 2. File Organization
- Within each folder, samples are organized into files.
- Typically, each file contains samples that illustrate a particular topic within the current work on Yakut morphology.
- As a result, the 'chapter', 'topic', and 'section' fields must be consistent across all samples in a file.
- However, the 'page' and 'notes' fields are sample-specific and can vary within the file.
