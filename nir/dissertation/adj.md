## Adjectives



Since the affix *-тык* essentially forms adverbs only from adjectives, the ability of a word to accept this affix can be considered confirmation that the given word is an adjective, , and in a polysemantic word the meaning of the adjective is dominant or basic. Thus, this affix can sometimes be used as an auxiliary criterion in establishing the basic meaning of a polysemantic word. This affix is usually added to those adverbs that can simultaneously be used in the meaning of an adjective. In this case, the affix seems to strengthen the form of the adverb. For example, the word ыраах is most often used in the meanings of "far and far away" (in the meaning of "far", this word is rarely used). The main meaning here can be recognized as the meaning of an adverb, since this word does not combine with the affix *-тык* [1:352].
