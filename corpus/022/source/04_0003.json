This is invariable for the number of years, while there are three instances of sa:s occurring without a possessive suffix, e.g (105c). As was explained to me by my consultant in the Verxojansk district, this emphasizes the very substantial age of the speaker (88 years old); a younger person would not be able to use this unpossessed expression. Furthermore, periods of time in a person’s life that are still continuing are marked for possessor (105d).",
