Morphological Pipeline for Processing Word Forms in the Yakut Language

A morphological pipeline for the Yakut language would involve several stages to effectively analyze and generate word forms, considering its agglutinative structure. The pipeline could be structured as follows:

Tokenization:
Breaking down the text into tokens, identifying boundaries between words and morphemes.

Lexical Lookup:
Checking if the word root exists in the lexicon. Since it's difficult to cover all roots, this stage would account for both known and unknown roots.

Morphophonological Analysis:
Applying morphophonological rules to understand how suffixes interact with roots, given the specific phonological features of the Yakut language, such as vowel harmony.

Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words:
For words absent in the lexicon, generating hypotheses about possible roots and affixes by analyzing syllable structure and common patterns in Yakut word formation.

Morphological Disambiguation:
In cases where multiple morphological interpretations are possible, the system would minimize ambiguity using context or probabilistic models.

Word Form Generation:
Based on the root and the identified morphemes, the pipeline would generate possible word forms following the morphophonological rules.

Evaluation and Correction:
The output is evaluated for correctness, and if necessary, adjustments are made based on additional linguistic constraints or feedback loops.

This pipeline would help in efficient morphological processing, especially in resolving the challenges posed by the agglutinative nature and rich morphology of the Yakut language.
