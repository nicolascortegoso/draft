This is a strictly morphological analysis, not a syntactic one. Syntactically, it's a finite verb, but morphologically, it's built from a participle and a possessive su


Title: Грамматика современного якутского литературного языка. Фонетика и морфология (Grammar of the Modern Yakut Literary Language. Phonetics and Morphology).

Authors: A collective work by the Institute of Language, Literature and History, Yakutsk.

Why it's key: It is purely morphological (and phonological). It is the definitive source for the form and inventory of all morphemes: nominal declensions, verbal conjugations, derivational suffixes. It describes what exists in incredible detail, with thousands of examples.


1. Morphological Analysis (The "WHAT")

This is the analysis of a word's internal structure. It answers the question: "What are the pieces that make up this word and what do they mean/form?"

    Focus: The word itself, in isolation.

    Goal: To segment the word into its smallest meaning-bearing units (morphemes) and label their form and morphosyntactic category.

    What it identifies:

        Root/Stem: The core lexical meaning (e.g., уч- (fly), книга (book), зелен- (green)).

        Derivational Affixes: Morphemes that change the part of speech or core meaning (e.g., -тель in учитель (teacher -> "one who teaches"), -ость in храбрость (bravery)).

        Inflectional Affixes: Morphemes that express grammatical relationships without changing core meaning (e.g., -ет for 3sg present tense, -а for feminine singular, -ом for instrumental case).

    Output: A breakdown like:

        учи-тель-ниц-а (teach-DER.NOM-DER.FEM-NOM.SG)

        про-чит-а-л-и (PFX-read-VERB-PAST-PL)

        книг-ам (book-DAT.PL)

    Analogy: In a car engine, morphological analysis identifies the pistons, valves, spark plugs, and camshaft. It describes their shape, material, and immediate function (e.g., "this opens to let in fuel").

2. Functional (Syntactic) Analysis (The "WHAT JOB")

This is the analysis of a word or phrase's role within a sentence. It answers the question: "What grammatical function does this unit serve in this specific sentence?"

    Focus: The relationship between words in a sentence.

    Goal: To identify the syntactic functions and hierarchical structure of the sentence.

    What it identifies:

        Syntactic Functions/Roles: Subject, Direct Object, Indirect Object, Adverbial, Modifier, Predicate, etc.

        Phrase Structure: How words group into phrases (Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase, Prepositional Phrase).

        Dependencies: Which word governs or is dependent on another (e.g., a verb governs the case of its object).

    Output: A parse tree, dependency graph, or labels like:

        [SUBJ Новый учитель] [PRED объяснил] [DO правило] [ADV очень понятно].

        (The new teacher explained the rule very clearly.)

    Analogy: In a car engine, functional analysis describes the job of those parts in the system: "The camshaft's function is to time the opening of the valves, which allows the fuel-air mixture to enter the combustion chamber, which is triggered by the signal from the crankshaft."

Side-by-Side Comparison with a Yakut Example

Sentence: Оҕолор киногөрдүлэр. (The children are watching a movie.)
Aspect	Morphological Analysis	Functional (Syntactic) Analysis
Focus	The words оҕолор and киногөрдүлэр.	The relationship between оҕолор and киногөрдүлэр.
Question	What are the parts of these words?	What job does each word group do in the sentence?
Analysis of оҕолор	Root: оҕо (child).
Affix: -лөр (plural suffix).
Output: оҕо-лөр (child-PL)	Role: Subject of the sentence.
Output: [SUBJ Оҕолор]
Analysis of киногөрдүлэр	Root: кино (movie).
Deriv. Affix: -гөр (?? look/see related).
Deriv. Affix: -дү (causative/make).
Infl. Affix: -лэр (3rd person plural present).
Output: кино-гөр-дү-лэр (movie-look-CAUS-3PL)	Role: Predicate (the main verb phrase).
Its sub-components have functions:
кино is the Direct Object inside the verb.
Output: [PRED киногөрдүлэр] (which contains [DO кино])
Overall Output	A list of morphemes with their form-based labels.	A structure showing Оҕолор (Subject) performs the action киногөрдүлэр (Predicate).
