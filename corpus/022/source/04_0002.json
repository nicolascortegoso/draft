Uvarovskij uses the expression аҕа ийэ икки [father mother two] ‘father and mother’ (a coordinate noun phrase as compared to the compound occasionally used nowadays) when referring to his parents, marking both terms for possession of 1SG possessor.",

		"notes": "As to the Russian copies mama and papa, in my texts these were used very rarely; only four speakers used the term mama, three of whom used it only with possessive marking (6 tokens), while the fourth speaker, a woman who very frequently switched to Russian while telling me her story, used it 14 times. This speaker used it without possessive marking only four out of the 14 times; and one of these unmarked tokens was within a Russian clause. The term papa was used only six times by three speakers, and it was used only once without a possessive marker by the above-mentioned speaker when referring to her step-father.",

As explained to me by one consultant, a dominant family member can indicate his/her dominance by omitting the (expected) possessive suffixes on kinship terms. For instance, a woman who was very clearly the head of the family indicated this by frequently not marking the possessor on the terms denoting children and in-laws (101a). Another speaker, who had complained quite bitterly about her grandchildren being so greedy and demanding and exhausting (a very un-characteristic thing for a Sakha to do), also referred to these grandchildren five times out of six without possessive marking, e.g. (101b). Furthermore, the lack of possessive marking appears to indicate a form of emotional distance; thus, when it was mentioned that children died (101c) or suffered (101d) the possessive marking was omitted.",
