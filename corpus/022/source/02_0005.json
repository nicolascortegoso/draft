It marks the standard of comparison in comparative constructions (62a, b), while the adjective, for which no comparative or superlative forms exist, remains invariant. An exception is made, however, for comparative constructions regarding age: here, the standard of comparison is marked by the Ablative case, while the relative age (‘younger’, ‘older’) is expressed by the words быраат ‘younger.brother’ or балыс ‘younger.sister’ and aҕa ‘father’ (62c). Nowadays, however, быраат and балыс are being replaced more and more by кыра ‘small’.",
