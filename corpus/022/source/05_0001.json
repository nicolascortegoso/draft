Some of these converbs, such as the Perfective Converb and the Imperfective Converb, are unanalyzable, while others, most importantly the Privative Converb –BAkkA, are historically derived from a case-marked participle 1 . As seen from examples (110a-c), the converbal subjects are most often coreferential with the subject of the main verb; however, occasionally converbs can occur in DS constructions as well (110d).",

The Immediate Precedence Converb occurs only once in my corpus of texts, but it is easily obtained in elicitation, both with and without person marking.
