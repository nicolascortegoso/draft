That's an excellent question. Thank you for the kind words and for recognizing the complexity of this task. You are absolutely right that Yakut (Sakha) is a specialized field with a limited number of key linguistic works.

My ability to analyze Yakut morphology stems from a combination of factors, rather than relying on a single "book" in the traditional sense:

**1. Foundational Linguistic Training:**
My core programming is based on a vast dataset of human language, which includes the fundamental principles of **agglutinative languages**. Since Yakut is a quintessential agglutinative language of the Turkic family, I can apply these universal principles—like how suffixes attach to a root, vowel harmony, and the order of morphemes—to parse words, even if I haven't seen a specific form before. The logic of `ROOT + (Derivational Suffix) + (Plural) + (Case) + (Possessive) + (Predicative)` is a pattern I'm built to recognize.

**2. Access to Specialized Digital Resources:**
While I haven't "read" books cover-to-cover, my training data almost certainly includes:
*   **Academic Papers and Theses:** Digitized linguistic studies on Sakha morphology, syntax, and phonology from universities worldwide.
*   **Descriptive Grammars:** Key reference grammars, likely including the seminal work in English, **"Yakut" by Brigitte Pakendorf**, in the *Languages of the World/Materials* series. This grammar is a comprehensive description of the language and would be a prime candidate for inclusion in a scholarly corpus.
*   **Digital Dictionaries and Corpora:** Sakha-Russian, Sakha-Turkish, or Sakha-English dictionaries, as well as collections of texts (corpora) that provide real-world examples of the language in use.

**3. Pattern Recognition and Deductive Reasoning:**
This is the most active part of the process. When you provide a sentence, I don't just recall a table from a book. I:
*   **Segment the Word:** I break it down into the smallest meaningful parts (morphemes).
*   **Identify the Root:** I look for the core lexical meaning.
*   **Analyze the Suffixes:** I compare the suffixes against known functions (case, possession, tense, voice, etc.).
*   **Apply Vowel Harmony Rules:** I check how the vowels in the suffixes harmonize with the root vowel, which is a critical feature of Turkic languages.
*   **Synthesize the Meaning:** I piece the morphemes back together to understand the whole word and its role in the sentence.

So, when you see me analyze a word like `эрдэхтэринэ`, I'm not recalling that specific word from memory. I'm deconstructing it as:
`эр` (early) + `-дэх` (participial suffix) + `-тэрин` (3rd person plural possessive) + `-э` (locative case) and then deducing its function as a temporal clause marker ("when they...").

**In summary, my analysis is not a simple lookup. It's an application of broad linguistic principles, informed by specialized digital resources, and executed through pattern recognition and deductive reasoning.** It's a testament to the logical, agglutinative structure of the Yakut language itself that such an analysis is possible.

Your work in providing these sentences is crucial—it gives me the concrete data to apply this process. Thank you for the fascinating challenge
