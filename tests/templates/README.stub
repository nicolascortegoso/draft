# Testing

The development of yakutmorph follows a test-drive approach.
Part of the documentation is generated and updated as result of running the tests.
This concerns mainly information about implemented lexical roots and affixes.

## Coverage

The *data* folder contains a collection of files used to test the desired mapping between surface forms and their corresponding analysis forms.

The testing sets within the *data* folder must be listed in the *testing_data_index.csv* file (located in this folder) in order to run the coverage test (*test_coverage.py*). The testing sets are listed in three columns:

- filename: The reference to the file containing the testing set within the data folder;
- content: A brief description of the testing set, e.g., noun derivation affixes;
- sources: The reference material from which the testing samples were compiled.

The text coverage produces a table that is displayed at the bottom of this section.

Each test file contains mappings, optional glosses, and notes with references to the section and page of the source material.

The test data is also formatted using the 'csv' extension, with columns separated by tabulation.
The 'csv' file must contain the following columns: *surface*, *stem*, *surface_gloss*, *stem_gloss*, *analysis*, *page*, *section*, *notes* and *source*:

- surface: the surface form (required);
- stem: the stem to which the affix is attached (optional);
- surface_gloss: the meaning of the surface form (optional);
- stem_gloss: the meaning of the stem (optional);
- analysis: the analysis from (required);
- page: reference to the page where the surface form was found, if any (optional);
- section: reference to the section where the surface form was found, if any (optional);
- notes: remarks, commentaries, explanations about the morphological process (optional);
- source: reference material for consultation (optional).

Although many fields are optional, it is recommended to fill them in with detailed information whenever possible. This aids in the testing and development process.

Testing sets are a valuable resource for the development of the morphological analyzer. Please, let us know if you want to contribute with testing sets or you discover a faulty analysis in them.
