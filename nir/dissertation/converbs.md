Converbs: Converbs are non-finite verb forms that typically function as adverbial modifiers, indicating the manner, time, cause, or condition of the action expressed by the main verb. In Turkic languages, converbs are often marked by specific suffixes (e.g., -а/-ө in Yakut) and can combine with other verbs to form complex predicates or modify actions.

The process of forming adverbs from converbs involves taking a converb, which already has an adverbial function, and further deriving it into a standalone adverb using additional morphology. This is a natural extension of the converb’s role as an adverbial modifier.

Converbs are frequently used as bases for further derivation, including adverb formation.

Converbs are inherently adverbial in function, often describing how, when, or why an action occurs. Adding an adverbial suffix like -түк refines or generalizes this function, allowing the converb to act as a fully-fledged adverb independent of a specific verbal context.

In the sentence көнөтүк тур, көнөтүк functions as an adverb modifying the imperative verb тур ("stand"). The suffix -түк ensures that көнөтүк is not a converb requiring a dependent clause but a standalone adverb of manner, which is appropriate for the imperative construction.
Without -түк, көнө alone might imply a converbial clause (e.g., "having corrected, stand"), which would require additional context or a main clause. The -түк suffix simplifies the structure into a direct command.
