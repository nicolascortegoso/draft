## Modals

Proper modal words form the core vocabulary of modal words as auxiliary part of speech.
These include those words that have finally emerged from the vocabulary of other parts of speech in a special modal meaning [Petrov:69].

Proper modal words also includes words whose basic meaning differs sharply from the semantics of their etymon, and now in relation to it they can be considered as absolute homonyms.
For example, *баҕар* (perhaps) is also the imperative form of the verb *баҕар* (to want), but there is no direct connection between their meanings now. [Petrov:69].
