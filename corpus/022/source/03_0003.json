		"notes": "As to the formal similarity between the Sakha Future Imperative suffix –A:r and the Mongolic Prescriptive –A:rAy, this is not so great as it would seem. There exists an emphatic form of the Future Imperative in Sakha (cf. example 67e, repeated here as 82) which ends in an (optionally long) high vowel; it is this form that is compared to the Mongolic Prescriptive (Btl: 304; Poppe 1959). However, this emphatic form is (currently) not very widespread, but is found predominantly in the Suntar dialect10 (own observation); Ubrjatova states that this is a dialectalism that has entered the standard language, without giving precise information about which dialect it may have come from (Ubr: 180). Furthermore, this emphatic form exists for the Present Imperative as well.",

It is unclear whether this 3SG Voluntative-Potential has anything to do with the Mongolic Prescriptive (probably not); nevertheless, the existence of this form in the Sakha verbal inflectional paradigm further weakens the case for copying of the emphatic Future Imperative suffix –A:rI:y from Mongolic.",
