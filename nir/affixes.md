# Affixes


E.I. Ubryatova et al. divide affixes by meaning into word-formation and inflectional.
Word-forming affixes include those affixes that supplement or change the lexical meaning of the base and form a derivative base from it, which acts as a new independent word that can take on various affixes.
For example, from the base of the nominal word *балык* "fish", the affix *-лаа (-таа)* forms the derivative verb *балыктаа-* *(to catch fish, to fish)*.
This derivative verbal base acts as a new independent word that can take on various affixes characteristic of the verb.


Most of inflectional affixes correspond to a specific morpheme with its respective phonological variations, following the rules of vowel harmony and the ending of the stem they attach to. 




Composed affixes.


An affix by itself or a combination of affixes?
Follow the theory.

Is desirable, as composed affixes increase analysis ambiguity.
For example: plural + accusative case.

There are design approaches taken during development.
For example, the reduplication of the reciprocal affix.
Better model the phonological changes that occur during affixation.



The mapping between derivational morphemes often is not one-to-one.
For example, the morpheme *-лаа* and allomorphs is the most widespread affix to derive verbal stems from other stem types.
However, Ubryatova list 9 more or less productive morphemes that are used to form verbal stems. They may introduce nuances in the meaning of the derived stem. 
Some affixes may attach only to a specific type of stem and/or ending. For example:

Those affixes are not considered allomorphs since they convey different shades in meaning or can be attached only to a particular type of stem.



Ubryatova et al. [[??]](#references) differentiate affixes based on their structure:

- monosyllabic (*таба-лар* reindeer, *таба-та* his reindeer)
- disyllabic (*суруй-ааччы* writer, *таба-таабар* the comparative form of reindeer).

Most of the affixes are monosyllabic. They can also consist of one vowel (*ат-а* "his horse") or just one consonant (*таба-м* "my reindeer").

Affixes may change its sound composition depending on the composition of the base.


In the case of adjectives and nouns - if their meaning is close-, it is recomended to list a root either as one of the two in order to reduce the number of interpretations in the output. For example, wealth/rich. This is by no means a trivial choice, so it is a good idea to refer to a work in lexicography, the derivational affixes that can be attached to the root (adjectives and nouns have similar but still different sets), or the root ending (fossilized affixes). 


Adverbial nouns: In such cases, in order to define a given word, it is necessary to consider the entire set of its semantic, syntactic and morphological properties. A word that can act as a subject in a sentence, has a full declension and can take all the forms characteristic of names, must be classified as a noun [[Kharitonov: 7]](#references).

Adverbial participles: Of the participial forms, the adverbial participle of accompanying and forthcoming action, usually called fused, is joined with adverbs. It is formed with the help of the affix -ыы (-ии, -уу, -үү); -а, (-э, -о, -ө). Some of these adverbial participles are used only as adverbs, a significantly greater number of them have only an adverbial participle meaning. Many of them have a dual function, acting sometimes as an adverb, sometimes as an adverbial participle. Since the morphological and syntactic features of these adverbs and adverbial participles coincide exactly, the difference between them can be established only semantically, by the meaning of a given combination of words. Fused adverbial participles, functioning only as adverbs, should be called adverbial participial adverbs [Kharitonov:7].
