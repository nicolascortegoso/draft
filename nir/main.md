Semantical, morphological and syntactic characteristics.


In the Yakut language, unlike other Turkic languages, an adjective as such is not used as a verb attribute. In order to become a verb attribute, an adjective must take the affix -tyk, thus turning into an adverb. Thus, in the Yakut language, the compatibility of a word with a verb can sometimes serve as a criterion for classifying a given word as an adverb or adjective. When a disputed word can serve as a verb attribute without an affixation, this will mean that in the language It is recognized as an adverb primarily. Otherwise, obviously, we will be talking about the predominance of the adjective function [2:35].
