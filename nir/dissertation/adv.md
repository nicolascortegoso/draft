Kharitonov L.N points out that adverbs in the Yakut language are morphologically much more developed than in other Turkic languages for the following facts [2:5]:
1. Yakut adverbs have a much larger number of living, productive affixes;
2. in the Yakut language an adjective is usually combined with a verb only with the help of an adverbial affix, whereas in other Turkic languages it is combined with the verb in its unchanged form;
3. the Yakut language has a significant number of non-derivative adverbs (dead words that function as adverbs).

In the Yakut language, an adverb is a lexically independent unchangeable word that serves as a definition of a feature, or an action, or a circumstance of an action. Morphologically, it is either a living, productive, or to some extent a fossilized and isolated form [2:5].


Syntactically, adverbs combine with verbs, verbal nouns and adverbial participles. Defining adverbs can also combine with adjectives and adverbs. A negative feature of an adverb is its incompatibility with a non-derivative noun that functions as a subject. A similar feature, to a certain extent, can be the fact that adverbs are not determined by an adjective. An adverb usually precedes the word to which it refers [2:6].

According to the type of semantic connection, adverbs can be divided into two main groups:
1) defining adverbs
2) adverbs of circumstance.


Non-derivative adverbs are related in function, firstly, to a number of nouns and adjectives. For example, the words *кыһын* (winter), *ыраах* (far away) can act as an adverb without any change in their form.
In such cases, in order to define a given word, it is necessary to consider the entire set of its semantic, syntactic and morphological properties. A word that can act as a subject in a sentence, has a full declension and can take all the forms characteristic of names, should be classified as a name. The fact that a given word is used instead of an adverb should be considered as its special function, conditioned by the peculiarities of its semantics, history, etc. Such a word should be classified as a name acting as an adverb [2:7].


All words that can act as non-derivative adverbs, according to their grammatical nature, can be conditionally divided into the following groups [2:9]:
1) proper adverbs: amorphous or fossilized words, which always act only as adverbs and serve in a sentence as a definition of a feature and action or as a circumstance. These words themselves do not directly accept word-changing affixes, although verbs and names are formed from many of them (Kharitonov estimates around 160 lexical units)
2) adverbs acting as names: are mainly used as adverbs, but in context they can sometimes act as names.
3) names acting as adverbs
4) pronominal adverbs
5) adverbs acting as postpositional particles.


An adverb is a lexically full-fledged unchangeable word denoting a feature or circumstance of an action, as well as a feature or degree of another feature [1:343].

Adverbs in the Yakut language are represented, on the one hand, by a significant number of dead and isolated forms, mainly of nominal and verbal origin. On the other hand, there are numerous derivative adverbs formed from various parts of speech with the help of highly productive affixes. These affixes form only adverbs and can also be recognized as a distinctive morphological feature of adverbs.

Syntactically, adverbs are characterized by the fact that they combine with verbs, participles, adverbial participles, verbal nouns, as well as adjectives and other adverbs.
A negative distinctive feature of an adverb is its incompatibility with a noun of non-verbal origin, as well as its indefinability by an adjective. An adverb usually precedes the word to which it refers.

According to their meaning, adverbs can be divided into two groups: defining and circumstantial adverbs [1:343]:

Defining adverbs characterize an action or feature by their essence, by the peculiarities of their manifestation in reality. Defining adverbs can also be divided into two groups: adverbs of quantity and measure and adverbs of quality and manner of action.
These adverbs answer the questions: *төһө?, төһө элбэхтик?* (how much?, how many?), *хаста?* (how many times?).

Among the derivative adverbs, these include adverbs with the affix *-тык* and adverbs formed from numerals using the affixes *-та* and *-ын*.

Circumstantial adverbs indicate the external circumstances and relationships under which the action is performed. The adverbs of this group answer the questions *хайдах?*, *хайдах гынан?* (how?), *хайдах быһыылаахтык?* (which way?).

These adverbs are the most numerous. Adverbs of manner are especially numerous and varied. The latter include most of the derivative adverbs formed from different stems.
For example: *-лыы* from nominals stems; *-тык* from adjectives, *-ччы, -чы, -ы* from verbal stems. This also includes adverbs ending in *-a (-ыы)* [1:345].

Adverbial adverbs in the Yakut language are much less developed than determining adverbs. They are represented almost exclusively by non-derivative forms. By meaning, adverbial adverbs can be divided into the following groups:
- adverbs of place
- adverbs of time
- adverbs of motive (reason and purpose).

Adverbs of place indicate the location or direction of an action. They answer the questions *ханна?* (where?), *ханан?* (where to?), *хантан?* (from where?), *хайа диэки?* (in what direction?).

Adverbs of time indicate the time of the action. They answer the questions *хаһан?* (when?), *төһөҕө?* (at what time?).

Adverbs of motive indicate the reason or purpose of the action being performed. They answer the questions: *тоҕо?* (why?, for what purpose?), *туохтан?* (from what?). Here can also be included derivative forms formed from verbs by means of the affix *-бычча*.

Words used as non-derivative adverbs have a heterogeneous morphological nature and origin.
According to their morphological structure and origin, these words can be divided into the following groups [1:347]:
- indecomposable words
- dead formations with unclear etymology
- forms of verbal origin
- forms of nominal origin
- paired and doubled adverbs
- adverb phrases
- adverbs borrowed from the Russian language

In modern language, numerous adverbs are formed with the help of living affixes from various other words. Almost from every verb, noun, adjective, numeral and pronoun, various adverbs can be formed with the help of one or another living affix. Adverbial affixes can even be attached to many adverbs and function words [1:350].

### Formation of adverbs from verbal stems

Affix *-ы (-и, -у, -у)* forms adverbs of manner from some causative or imperative verbs. The same affix is found in a number of adverbs of a dead or fossilized form [1:350].

Affix *-чы (-чи, -чий, -чү)* forms adverbs of manner from figurative and onomatopoeic verbs, as well as from some other verb stems [1:350].

Affix *-дыы (-тыы)* is a phonetic variant of the affix. *-лыы*, which forms adverbs from nominal forms. It forms adverbs from verbal nouns (participles) of the present and past tense [1:351].

Affix *-бычча (-пычча, -мычча)* consists of a combination of two affixes: *-быт* (form of the past participle) and *-ча*. Words with this affix denote an action that serves as a reason or motive for performing another action [1:351].

The affix *-ыатча (-иэхчэ, -уохча, -үөхчэ)* represents the addition of two affixes: *-ыах* (the form of the future participle) and *-ча* (the non-productive affix of the adverb). Words with this affix retain the meaning of action to an even greater extent and represent a form that is difficult to consider a typical adverb. Unlike ordinary adverbs, these words cannot serve as an explanation for another verb, but are used only as a main component [1:351].

In addition to the above forms, participles with the affix *-а (-ыы)* are to a certain extent a source of replenishment of the adverbial vocabulary. A number of these participles have long since lost their participle meaning and have turned into adverbs [1:352].


### Formation of adverbs from nominal stems

Affix *-тык (-дык, -лык, -нык)* forms defining adverbs (of measure and quantity, quality and manner of action) from non-derivative and many derived adjectives. It can also be attached to some adverbs and function words [1:352].

The affix *-лыы (-тыы, -дыы, -ныы)* forms adverbs from a wide variety of names, including verbal names. The meaning of the adverbs formed seems somewhat heterogeneous due to the too wide range of applicability of the affix and the semantic diversity of the bases from which the adverbs are formed. In terms of meaning, they are primarily adverbs of manner, answering the questions how? in what manner? like what, whom? The affix is especially productive in relation to nouns, since it can form an adverb from almost any noun [1:353].

The affix *-лары (-тары, -дары, -нары)* forms adverbs of joint meaning from some nominal bases that act as adverbs of time or place, as well as from some adverbs [1:353]. The productivity of affixes in this usage is insignificant [1:354].

The affix *-та* forms adverbs with the meaning of so many times quantitative, dividing and approximate numerals. This affix is also applied to some indefinite quantitative nouns and adverbs of measure and quantity [1:354].

Affixes *-ыа (-иэ, -уо, -үө)* and *-ыа (-иэ, -уо,-үө)* and *-ыан (-иэн, -уон, -үөн)* are usually considered as forms of collective numerals. However, numerals can serve as an attribute of a noun, while these forms never act as an attribute. In addition, numerals can be declined, while these forms are mostly unchangeable. Therefore, the inclusion of these forms in the category of numerals is justified only in semantic terms. The affixes *-ыа* and *-ыан* can also be considered as forms of formation of adverbs from cardinal numbers of the first ten, starting with two [1:354].

Affix *-ын (-ин, -ун, -үн)*. Forms adverbs from ordinal and diminutive-collective numerals [1:354].


### Formation of adverbs form other adverbial stems

A significant number of adverbs can take additional adverbial affixes, giving them new shades of meaning. At the same time, the basic meaning of the original adverb is preserved [1:354].

Affixes *-та (-рыта)* in some adverbs of verbal origin ending in *-ы (-и, -у, -у)*, as well as participial and non-derivative adverbs ending in *-а* give the meaning of multiplicity. The action of the corresponding verb is directed repeatedly at the same object or a one-time action directed to a multiple number of objects. With verbs of reciprocal voice, adverbs ending in *-та* can also denote simple reciprocity of action without the meaning of multiple or plurality [1:354].

Affixes *-ыары, -лык* convey the meaning of diminutiveness to some words used as non-derivative adverbs of time, less often, of place [1:355].

Affix *-чы (-ччы)* give some adverbs an intensifying shade of meaning [1:355].

Affix *-лыы* give the additional meaning of orientation of the direction when attached to words denoting the cardinal directions and used in the function of an adverb [1:355].

Affixes *-тык, -ччы, -ын* are used as additional strengthening of the adverb form. This phenomenon is often observed in cases where a given word can also be used in the meaning of other parts of speech, and therefore in the context there is a need for special strengthening or clarification of the adverb form. The affix *-тык* can be added to non-derivative adverbs that can also be used in the meaning of an adjective, as well as to proper adverbs. The affix *-ччи* is often added to adverbs of manner ending in a vowel [1:356].


SINTAXIS: The usual function of an adverb is to act as a circumstance with a verb, as well as as a definition with a verb, adjective, and adverb. Combination with non-derivative nouns, numerals, and pronouns is unusual for an adverb. The author points out that adverbs do not act as subjects at all [2:35].

An adverb usually precedes the word to which it refers. This, by the way, is one of the most important differences between adverbs and postposition particles. The latter always stand after the word to which they refer. In addition, a postposition is always located immediately after a noun, whereas the immediate proximity of an adverb to its combination is common, but not obligatory [2:47].
