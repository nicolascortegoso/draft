# Modals

Petrov [139]
Proper modal words are vocabulary units devoid of nominative semantics and used only to express the speaker's attitude.
They constitute a large independent group, occupying a very definite place among other proper function words.

Petrov [139]
Modal words proper have been completely isolated from notional words; in many cases, their connection with their etymon can only be determined by means of etymological analysis, and the origin of some words is now completely unclear.

Among the function words, they also clearly occupy a special position in terms of their semantic and syntactic features.
The observed cases of their combining union or interjection meanings are quite rare. At the same time, some modal words simply have a noticeable shade of union or interjection meaning, others are homonymous with interjections or conjunctions, and still others are hybrid words that combine the function of conjunctions and modal words almost equally, reflecting the results of the peculiar semantic development of grammaticalized words.

Petrov [139]
A characteristic feature of modal words proper is the polysemy of their overwhelming majority.
The more abstract the semantics of a word, the more often the functional shades of its meanings are manifested.
This is explained by the fact that the modality of the entire sentence is made up of a unique interweaving and interaction of the meanings of various means of expressing modality present in the given sentence, and in this case the abstract semantics of the modal word acquires one or another new shade.
However, the syntactic function of modal words is quite definite: they can be introductory or accompanying members of a sentence or a word-sentence in dialogic speech.
