## Numerals

El número es un atributo cuantitativo de un objeto o como un concepto separado e independiente.
En el primer caso, el número denota la cantidad de un objeto y se usa en combinación con un sustantivo, acercando su papel sintáctico al de un adjetivo. En el segundo caso, el numeral actúa en el significado de una sustancia y adquiere las propiedades gramaticales de un sustantivo [1:174].

In a sentence, a numeral most often serves as a definition and a predicate. A separate number name in a sentence can serve as a subject, object, and circumstance, as well as a predicate.

Syntactically, a numeral differs:
- from a noun in that it does not allow a definition before it.
- from an adjective in that it forms adverbs by means of a different affix (-та instead of -тык) and it does not combine with adverbs of measure and degree.

The derivative forms of the numeral preserve the original and basic lexical meaning with a certain modification.

In the Yakut language, the following categories of numerals are distinguished:

1) cardinal
2) ordinal
3) approximate
4) distributive
5) collective
6) fractional

### 1. Cardinal numbers

In their structure and meaning, cardinal numbers in the Yakut language are the original basis from which the forms of all other categories of the numeral are formed:

Cardinal numerals denote the quantity of an object or an abstract number. In both cases, they answer the questions *хас?* / *төһө?* (how many).

| numeral  | meaning  |
|:---------|:---------|
| биир     | one      |
| икки     | two      |
| үс       | three    |
| түөрт    | four     |
| биэс     | five     |
| алта     | six      |
| сэттэ    | seven    |
| аҕыс     | eight    |
| тоҕус    | nine     |
| уон      | ten      |
| сүүрбэ   | twenty   |
| отут     | thirty   |
| сүүс     | hundred  |

The modern Yakut language does not have the name of a thousand. Instead, it is used the form *тыһыынча* borrowed from the Russian language [1:175]. Million and billion are denoted by the same international words *миллион* и *миллиард*, also borrowed from the Russian language. It was observed that sometimes the orthography is adapted to the Yakut language: *мөлүйүөн* (миллион), *милийээр* (миллиард).

Compound numerals are a combination of two or more words. For example: *сүүс уон биир* (one hundred eleven).

The names of numbers in the order of tens, except for twenty and thirty, are based on the indication of the number of tens. For example: *түөрт уон* (forty), *алта уон* (eighty).

The names of the third-order and four-order numbers (hundreds) also come from the indication of the number of hundreds: *иики сүүс* (two hundreds), *отут тыһыынча* (thirty millions), an so on.

Some cardinal numbers, in addition to their usual numerical meaning, carry an additional semantic load and have special lexical meanings. For example, the numeral *биир*, in addition to the meaning 'one', also denotes the sameness and commonality of objects and phenomena [1:177].

Cardinal numbers are used in the forms of possession, predicate and declension [1:178].

### 2. Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numerals indicate the order of objects by count or their place in a row of other objects. They answer the question *хаһыс?* (which one? which one in a row?).

These numerals are formed from cardinal numerals through aff. *-с*, *-ыс* (*-ис*, *ус*, *ус*). For example *иккис* (second), *төрдүс* (fourth), *алтыс* (sixth) [1:180].

Ordinal numerals can take the forms of the simple and possessive cases when replacing nouns. Then they can serve as a subject, object and circumstance in a sentence [1:181].

Ordinal numerals borrowed from Russian, such as *пиэрибэй* (first), *торуой* (second), *тириэтэй* (third), *десятай* (tenth), *суотай* (hundredth), *тысячнай* (thousandth), are also used [1:182].


### 3. Approximate numbers

An approximate numeral indicates an approximate or imprecise number of items. It answers to the questions? *төһө?* (how much?).

Morphologically they are formed from the names of round tens and hundreds by means of the affixes *-ча/-чэ*. For example, *от уон* (about ten), *сүүрбэччэ* (about twenty), *икки сүүсчэ* (about two hundreds).

Along with affixal forms, there are syntactic forms of approximate numerals. They are formed by pairwise combinations of the names of the numbers of the first ten (from 1 to 9) and indicate the approximate quantity within a unit [1:182]. For example: *биир-икки* (one-two), *биэс-алта* (five-six).

Numerals of this type are sometimes formed by combining with the word *хас* (how much) [1:182]. For example: *ус хас* (about three), *биэс хас* (about five).

Approximate numbers can take both simple and possessive case declensions.

Adverbs denoting the repetition of an action are formed by means of the affix *-та* from all approximate numerals. For example: *уончата* (about ten times), *сүүрбэччэтэ* (about twenty times). 

Taking the affix *-лаах*, approximate numerals usually also denote age [1:183]. For example: *уончалаах уол* (a boy of about ten years old).

Derived verbs from approximate numerals are not widely used. Sometimes it is possible to find reflexive verbs like *уончаланным* (I was about ten years old) [1:183]. Compound verbs are formed with the help of the auxiliary verbs *буол* and *гын*. For example: *отучча буол* (to gather in numbers of about thirty), *сүүрбэччэ гын* (to divide into approximately twenty parts) [1:178]. 


### 4. Distributive numerals

The divisive numeral indicates the quantitative distribution of objects. Answers the question "by how much?" [1:183].

These numerals are formed from cardinal and approximate numerals with the help of the affixes *-лыы/-тыы/-дыы,/-ныы*. For example: *абыстыы* (eight each), *биирдии* (one each), *уончалыы* (approximately ten each), *сүүсчэлии* (approximately one hundred each).

Quite often these numerals are used as adverbial modifiers, approaching the meaning of adverbs [1:183].

Distributive numerals often take case affixes, usually of simple declension [1:184].

The affix *-та/-тэ* forms adverbs from these numerals, denoting an equal distribution of the number of repetitions of an action or an equal distribution of objects [1:184].


### 5. Collective numerals

A collective numeral denotes a quantity of objects understood as a set. It answers the question *хаһыа?* (in what quantity?) [1:184].

Collective numerals are formed with the help of the aff: *-ыа*, *-ыан*, *-ыайах* from cardinal numerals and retain the basic, original meaning of the numeral.

Affix *-ыа (-из, -уо, -үө)* forms collective numerals from cardinal numbers, used mainly as a predicate. For example: *тохсуо* (in the quantity of nine), *үһүө* (in the quantity of three).

Affix *-ыан (-иэн, -уон, -үөн)* forms a collective form, used primarily as an adverbial word. This form represents affix *-ыа*, extended by the final element *-н* *(-ыа + -н)* [1:185]. For example: *алтыан* (all six), *сэттиэн* (all seven). This form is implemented as an adverbial derivation from collective numerals.

Affix *-ыайах (-иейэх, -уойах, -үөйэх)* forms collective numerals with a restrictive-diminutive meaning [1:185]. For example: *алтыайах* (just eight), *сэттиэйэх* (just seven). This form is implemented as a special diminutive for collective numerals.



### 6. Fractional numerals

A fractional numeral is the name of a part of a whole number or an object [1:186].

Fractional numerals can be simple or compound. The former include anar *аҥар*, as well as borrowed from Russian *чиэппэр* (quarter), *суотай* (a hundredth), *балтараа* (one and a half).

The remaining fractional numerals are compound, representing a combination of several words. They are formed from cardinal numerals syntactically, using the participle of the auxiliary verb *гын-* (to do). 
First, it is given the number of parts into which the whole is divided (the denominator of the fraction); followed by the past participle of the 3rd person singular *гын-* and the possessive form of a cardinal numeral, indicating the number of parts taken (the numerator of the fraction). For example: *үс гыммыт биирэ* (1/3, lit.: one part divided into three), *түөрт гыммыт үһэ* (3/4, lit.: three parts divided into four) [1:186].


### About indefinite-quantitative numerals

Indefinite-quantitative are nominals that express the quantity of objects in a general form, without the help of numbers. Among such names there are words that belong to different categories: adjectives, pronouns, nouns, adverbs [1:187]. Therefore, they are listed in their respective sections.
