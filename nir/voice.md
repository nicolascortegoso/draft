## Voice Forming Affixes


В якутском языке, как и в других тюркских языках, переходность или непереходность действия не имеет своего внешнего различительного признака, отражаемого в структуре глагола [Ubryatova:254].


Voice is interpreted as “a mixed lexical-grammatical category, occupying an intermediate position between the so-called forms of words of formation and inflection” [Kharitonov, 11] [quoted by Danilova:103].
The basis for this is the fact that “...by means of voice affixes from the primary verb stem new verb stems are formed ...”, and on the other hand, “the voice form expresses the relationship of the action to the subject, which acquires a rather abstract content and reaches a relatively high degree of grammaticalization.”


Verb form that express the direction and relationship of the action to the object.
For example, from the stem *көр* (to see; to observe; to look) the following stems can be formed [Kharitonov, 1947:174].:
- *көрүн* (to look at yourself). Here the action is oriented to the subject that perform the action.
- *көрүлүн* (to be observed) can be formed. Here the object experienced the action performed by other.




Five voices with their allomorphs:

- base
- reciprocal-cooperative
- reflexive
- causative
- passive

### Transitive and intrasitive verbs

Kharitonov L.N. considers that in the Yakut language, the entire voice system represents a grammatical superstructure over the lexical meanings of transitivity (activity) and intransitivity (passivity) of an action. However, the transitivity or intransitivity of an action is not particularly reflected in the external structure of the primary stem of the verb, being instead purely lexical properties of the primary verb stems [1963:14].

The transitivity or intransitivity of the meaning of the verb plays an important role in the formation of most indirect voices. For example, reflexive, passive and partly motivating voices are formed in principle only from transitive verbs (more precisely, from active verbs) [idem].  The joint-mutual voice can in principle be formed from verbs of both meanings. But even here the mutual meaning of this voice is, as a rule, only possible with transitive verbs. As result, intransitive verbs are much less capable of forming voice forms [ibidem:14].

Moreover, the ability to form a form of one voice or another is determined primarily by the correspondence of the meaning of a given voice to the nature of the lexical meaning of the verb [idem]. This is not restricted by the transducer, that in generation mode would still append the affixes for the respective voice forms. 


#### Base voice

The primary stem of a verb expresses the concept of an action or state in its most general meaning, devoid of any qualifying nuances. In the meaning of the main voice, the logical subject of the action coincides with its grammatical subject: the action is thought of as being related directly to the actor, regardless of whether there is an object of the action or not. The form of the main voice is the most common and widespread form of verbs and is also the richest in terms of the possibilities of verb word formation [ibidem:13].

#### Causative voice

Causative verbs express an action that is induced or permitted by another person.
With these verbs, the role of the grammatical subject logically consists only of inciting or allowing the action. The real action logically relates to another object, which acts as a complement.

[Kharitonov, 1947:175]


#### Cooperative-Reciprocal voice

In the Yakut language, the meanings of compatibility and reciprocity of action are expressed by means of the same affix -с (-ыс) [1963:20].

The scope of application of the meaning of joint action does not coincide with the boundaries of the traditional division of verbs into transitive and intransitive. It is very extensive and covers not only transitive verbs, but also a very significant part of verbs with intransitive meaning [1963:21].



#### Reflexive voice

The subject is simultaneously the object of its own action, the action is concentrated on the actor himself: suu-n-ar ‘washes’ (from suuy ‘to wash, to wash’) [Slepsov]


#### Passive voice


Passive verbs, like reflexive verbs, are formed, as a rule, from transitive verbs (including causative-transitive ones). Only a few of them are formed from some verbs of motion and active manifestation [Ubryatova, 1982:266].


### Voice Morphotactics


От продуктивной основы других залогов глаголы возвратного залога обычно не образуются. Встречающиеся иногда возвратные глаголы от побудительного залога кажутся не совсем обычными [pag 82.]

Voice affixes can not only be attached to the verbal root, but they can be combined and even follow aspect affixes.
The schema below models the transitions between voice affixes.

The form of the main voice is the primary stem of the verb, which serves as the initial structural element for the formation of all derivative forms of the verb, including voice forms [ibidem:13].

In relation to the derived forms of the voice does the primary root of the verb acquire the meaning of a zero voice, which can be used as an initial measure for determining the semantic relations between different voices [idem].



FSA REPRESENTATION 


The correct classification of a verbal root as intrasitive/transitive is strictly necessary to produce the expected analyses.

A verbal stem might have an homonym with a different meaning. For instance, *бат* with the intransitive meaning of "to fit into" and transitive meaning of "to chase, to pursue"
[Kharitonov, 1963:58].


### Fossilized Voice Forms

The meaning of the main voice is also possessed by verbs that represent dead formations with voice affixes and do not express the modern meaning of the voice [Kharitonov, 1963:15].

DEFINITON

Change over time.


A systematic approach.

Listing a verbal root as fossilized (including a productive affix):

Two direct mechanism:

1) Linguistic works classifying a verbal root as fossilized. For example, Kharitonov [1963:120-124] gives a list of fossilized verbal stems.
2) The absence of a root in modern language from where the derived form could be potentially derived. In such cases, the lexical entries of a dictionary such as Slepsov's can be a source of consultation.

Possibility of a detailed lexical analysis.
The verbal roots that would require a more in deep lexical classification are listed separately.



#### Under segmentation

If a fossilized stem is not listed in the vocabulary, it would be analyzed as a verbal root, followed by a productive affix.
The solution is to simply list the fossilized form in the vocabulary.


#### Over segmentation

The presence of a verbal root that is no longer used in modern language, might produce the segmentation of a fossilized form.
The solution is to remove that verbal root from the vocabulary.


#### Morphological ambiguity

Often a derived form exist next to a fossilized stem. In those cases, the meaning of the fossilized stem diverges from the meaning that the productive affix would derive from the verbal root.
Therefore, the transducer should allow for both analysis, being this a problem of morphological ambiguity.
