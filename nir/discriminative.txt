How to do it:
Encode the input once.

Run your encoder on the input sequence (context, ambiguous word, etc.).

Get the hidden representation 
𝐻
H.

Score each candidate.

For each candidate output sequence:

Run the decoder conditioned on 
𝐻
H, but feed the candidate tokens instead of generating.

Compute the log-likelihood of that candidate sequence.

This gives you a score for each candidate.

Pick the best.

Rank candidates by their score.

Optionally normalize if you need proper probabilities.

encoder_output = encoder(input_sequence)

scores = []
for candidate in candidates:
    # teacher forcing: feed candidate tokens to decoder
    log_prob = decoder.score_sequence(candidate, encoder_output)
    scores.append(log_prob)

best_idx = torch.argmax(scores)
best_candidate = candidates[best_idx]
